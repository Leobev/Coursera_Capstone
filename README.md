# Coursera_Capstone: Car accident severity analysis for Seattle

Used for Applied Data Science capstone project

# Business Understanding:

Road accidents carry a substantial economic cost to the city of Seattle.  The local government is interested in analysis of collision data to help inform decisions that will hopefully reduce the volume and severity of traffic collisions in the city.  The objective is to develop a model that can accurately demonstrate a relationship between accident severity and other variables within the dataset.

# Data Understanding:

The collisions data was provided by the Seattle Police Department and recorded by Traffic Records Group of the SDOT Traffic Management Division.
